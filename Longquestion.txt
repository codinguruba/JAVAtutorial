What is OOP ? What are the characteristics of OOP?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes,
to represent and manipulate data. In OOP, a class defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have.
The object can then be manipulated and interacted with through those properties and methods. OOP allows for the creation of 
reusable, modular code, and can make it easier to organize and maintain a program.

The characteristics of OOP are

Inheritance: the ability for one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class,
allowing for code reuse and the creation of a class hierarchy.

Polymorphism: In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method,
depending on the type of object that is passed to the method.
To put it simply, polymorphism in Java allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit.
By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.

Abstraction in Java: Abstraction: the ability to define objects in terms of their properties and methods, rather than their specific implementation. 
This allows for the creation of general-purpose objects that can be easily reused and extended in different parts of a program
