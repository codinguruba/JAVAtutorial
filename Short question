What is JDK?
- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit that contains all the tools necessary to develop, compile, and run Java programs.


What is JVM?
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software that provides an environment for running Java programs.
It interprets the bytecode, which is a compiled form of the Java source code, and executes it on the computer's hardware.


What is bytecode?
- When you run a Java program, the source code is first compiled into bytecode.
Once the bytecode is generated, it is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


what is variable ?
-Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String - stores text, such as "Hello"

Why Java is called strongly typed language ?
- Java is called a strongly typed language because it requires all variables to be declared with a specific data type and it 
enforces strict type checking at compile time.

What is datatype in JAVA?
- A data type is a classification of data that defines the type of value a variable can hold,
the operations that can be performed on that data, and the amount of memory required to store it.

What is Garbage Collection ?
-Garbage collection in Java is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
 Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by an application.

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.

 Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
 
 What is Operator in JAVA?
 - Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.
 
 Arithmetic  - An arithmetic operator is a mathematical operator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, 
 subtraction, multiplication, and division. (* ,/, %, + , - ).
 
 Comparison operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) / Relational Operator
 Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 
 This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either true or false.

Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !)

These operators are used to combine multiple comparison statements and return a single boolean result.
&& (and) returns true if both operands are true, otherwise false.
|| (or) returns true if either operand is true, otherwise false.
! (not) returns the opposite of the operand (i.e., if the operand is true, ! returns false).
 
 // Simple Interest Program 
 
 import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SimpleInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner ob = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the principal amount: ");
        double principal = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the rate of interest: ");
        double rate = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the time (in years): ");
        double time = ob.nextDouble();
        double interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
        System.out.println("Simple Interest: " + interest);
    }
}

What is break statement in java
break statement is used to exit or break out of a loop.
When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes
at the next statement following the loop.

When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration is skipped and the program control moves to
the next iteration of the loop.

What is the difference between break and continue ?
In simple words, break statement is used to exit the loop and continue statement is used to 
skip an iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.
