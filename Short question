What is JDK?
- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit that contains all the tools necessary to develop, compile, and run Java programs.


What is JVM?
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software that provides an environment for running Java programs.
It interprets the bytecode, which is a compiled form of the Java source code, and executes it on the computer's hardware.


What is bytecode?
- When you run a Java program, the source code is first compiled into bytecode.
Once the bytecode is generated, it is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


what is variable ?
-Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String - stores text, such as "Hello"

Why Java is called strongly typed language ?
- Java is called a strongly typed language because it requires all variables to be declared with a specific data type and it 
enforces strict type checking at compile time.

What is datatype in JAVA?
- A data type is a classification of data that defines the type of value a variable can hold,
the operations that can be performed on that data, and the amount of memory required to store it.

What is Garbage Collection ?
-Garbage collection in Java is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
 Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by an application.

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.

 Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
 
 What is Operator in JAVA?
 - Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.
 
 Arithmetic  - An arithmetic operator is a mathematical operator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, 
 subtraction, multiplication, and division. (* ,/, %, + , - ).
 
 Comparison operators (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) / Relational Operator
 Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 
 This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either true or false.

Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables. For example,
+= , -= , =

Unary operators are used with only one operand.
For example, ++ is a unary operator that increases the value of a variable by 1. That is, ++5 will return 6.

Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !)

These operators are used to combine multiple comparison statements and return a single boolean result.
&& (and) returns true if both operands are true, otherwise false.
|| (or) returns true if either operand is true, otherwise false.
! (not) returns the opposite of the operand (i.e., if the operand is true, ! returns false).

Java Ternary Operator

Java Ternary operator is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. 
It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.
 
 // Simple Interest Program 
 
 import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SimpleInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner ob = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the principal amount: ");
        double principal = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the rate of interest: ");
        double rate = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the time (in years): ");
        double time = ob.nextDouble();
        double interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
        System.out.println("Simple Interest: " + interest);
    }
}

What is break statement in java
break statement is used to exit or break out of a loop.
When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes
at the next statement following the loop.
//break example//
public class Learning {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         for(int i = 1; i<=10 ;i++){
             if(i==5){
                 break;
             }
             System.out.println(i);
         }
       
        }
    }
   //continue// 
public class Learning {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         for(int i = 1; i<=10 ;i++){
             if(i==5){
                 continue;
             }
             System.out.println(i);
         }
       
        }
    }

What is continue statement in java?
When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration is skipped and the program control moves to
the next iteration of the loop.

What is the difference between break and continue ?
In simple words, break statement is used to exit the loop and continue statement is used to 
skip an iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.

What is the use of finalize() method in JAVA?
The Java finalize() method of Object class is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying 
the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection to perform clean-up activity.

What is constructor?
In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects.
It is automatically called when an object is created, and has the same name as the class.It has no return type.

What is type conversion in JAVA?
Converting one primitive datatype into another is known as type casting (type conversion) in Java.
Example
public class WideningExample {
   public static void main(String args[]){
      char ch = 'C';
      int i = ch;
      System.out.println(i);
   }
}

What is package in JAVA?
A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.

What is this keyword in java?
The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name

What is wildcard in java?
In Java, wildcards are a feature of generics that allow you to specify a type parameter with more flexibility. A wildcard is represented by the ? symbol,
and it can be used in two ways: as a wildcard parameter type in a generic type, or as a wildcard argument in a method or constructor.

What is recursion ? / What is recursive method in java?
- Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. 
A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.

What is dynamic method dispatch?
Dynamic method dispatch is a mechanism in object-oriented programming languages where the method to be executed is determined at runtime, 
based on the type of the object that the method is being invoked on.

What is inner class?
An inner class is a class defined inside another class. Inner classes are typically used to group related behaviors and encapsulate
them within the outer class, making the code more organized and readable.

what is the use of final keyword in java?
-The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

What is super keyword?
- The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

//do while 
public class Learning {
   public static void main(String args[]){
    int i = 0;   
    do{
        System.out.println("Helloworld"); 
        i++;
    }
    while(i<5);
   }
}

public class Learning {
   public static void main(String args[]){
    int i=0;
    while(i<5){
        System.out.println("Helloworld");
        i++;
    }
   }
}

//for each// 
public class Learning {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int a[] = {5,6,7,8,9};
       
       for(int element : a){   
           System.out.println(element);
           
       }
       
        
    }
}

What is array in java?
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};

What is autoboxing in java?
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types
and their corresponding object wrapper classes. 

What is static keyword in java?
The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. 
Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.

What is wrapper class in java?
In Java, wrapper classes are used to wrap primitive data types (such as int, char, double, etc.) into objects. 
The wrapper classes are part of the java.lang package and include: Integer, Character, Double, Boolean, Short, Long, Float, and Byte.

What is command line argument in java?
Java command line arguments are arguments that are passed to your program via a terminal or shell command. They make your Java program more configurable 
by giving users or scripts running your software a way to specify input parameters at run time.

What is JAVA (Nested class)?
-Java nested class is class that is declared inside the class.
Example//
class Outer{
//code
class Inner {
//code
}
}
What is class in Java?
A class — in the context of Java — is a template/blueprint used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.
Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category. All class objects should have the basic class properties.

What is inheritence in JAVA?
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

What is method overloading in JAVA?
-Method overloading in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than
one method with the same name, but with different parameters.

What is token in JAVA?
A token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. Tokens can be classified as follows:
Keywords
Identifiers
Constants
Special Symbols
Operators

What is interface in java?
- An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to describe a behavior that classes must implement. 

What is abstract class in java?
An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract —it may or may not include abstract methods. 
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed

What is object in java?
-A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. 
The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

What is subclass in java?
- A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class).

What happens when the main() isn't declared as static?
When the main method is not declared as static, 
then the program may be compiled correctly but ends up with a severe ambiguity and throws a run time error that reads "NoSuchMethodError."

Why is JAVA called platform independent?
- Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine. 
The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes

 Why is the main method static?
 
-Because the object is not required to call the static method. If we make the main method non-static,
JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method which will lead to the extra memory allocation

What are the restrictions that are applied to the Java static methods?
-Two main restrictions are applied to the static methods.
The static method can not use non-static data member or call the non-static method directly.
this and super cannot be used in static context as they are non-static.

What is method overriding:
-
If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class,
it is known as Method Overriding. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to implement the interface methods.

What is compile time polymorshism?
Compile-time polymorphism is obtained through method overloading. 
The term method overloading allows us to have more than one method with the same name. 
Since this process is executed during compile time, that's why it is known as Compile-Time Polymorphism.

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit.
By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.

What are local and instance variable?
Local variables are defined in the method and scope of the variables that exist inside the method itself.

Instance variable is defined inside the class and outside the method and the scope of the variables exists throughout the class.

What is the use of extends keyword in java?
The extends keyword extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class). 
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another
