What is JDK?
- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit that contains all the tools necessary to develop, compile, and run Java programs.


What is JVM?
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software that provides an environment for running Java programs.
It interprets the bytecode, which is a compiled form of the Java source code, and executes it on the computer's hardware.


What is bytecode?
- When you run a Java program, the source code is first compiled into bytecode.
Once the bytecode is generated, it is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


what is variable ?
-Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String - stores text, such as "Hello"

Why Java is called strongly typed language ?
- Java is called a strongly typed language because it requires all variables to be declared with a specific data type and it 
enforces strict type checking at compile time.

What is datatype in JAVA?
- A data type is a classification of data that defines the type of value a variable can hold,
the operations that can be performed on that data, and the amount of memory required to store it.

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.

 Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
 
 What is Operator in JAVA?
 - Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.
 
 Arithmetic  - An arithmetic operator is a mathematical operator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, 
 subtraction, multiplication, and division. (* ,/, %, + , - )
 
 // Simple Interest Program 
 
 import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class SimpleInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner ob = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the principal amount: ");
        double principal = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the rate of interest: ");
        double rate = ob.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter the time (in years): ");
        double time = ob.nextDouble();
        double interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
        System.out.println("Simple Interest: " + interest);
    }
}
